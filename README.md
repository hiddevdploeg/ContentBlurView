# ContentBlurView
Easily get a fancy looking gradient blur as seen on watchOS 10



## Installation
Ready to use on iOS 17+ or watchOS 10+.

1. In Xcode, select **Add Packagesâ€¦** from the File menu.
2. Enter `https://github.com/hiddevdploeg/ContentBlurView` in the search field.
3. Click **Add Package** (Set the Dependency Rule to Up to Next Major Version)
4. After adding the package, you will be able to import ContentBlurView in your project by using.

```swift
import ContentBlurView
```

## How use

It's as easy
```swift



```

Alternatively, you can customize the `BillboardView` and position it in any way that suits your app. This view takes a `BillboardAd`, a `BillboardConfiguration` (Optionally), and a view that represents your paywall:

```swift

@State private var advertisement: BillboardAd? = nil
@StateObject var viewModel = BillboardViewModel()


ContentView()
    .task {
        let newAdvert = try? await viewModel.fetchRandomAd()
        advertisement = newAdvert
    }
    .fullScreenCover(item: $advertisement) { advert in
        BillboardView(advert: advert, paywall: { Text("Paywall") })
    }

```

**TIP**: When you're running a debug version of your app you can tap on the timer to show a dismiss button right away.

## BillboardBannerView

If you don't fancy a fullscreen view but prefer a smaller banner to display within your content you can do that now too! Simple add a `BillboardBannerView` wherever you like.

```swift
@State private var advert: BillboardAd? = nil
ContentView()
    .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) {
        if let advert {
            BillboardBannerView(advert: advert)
                .padding()
        }
    }
```

By default it comes with a shadow, which you can opt-out from by changing the `includeShadow` value. Here's an example on how you could include a `BillboardBannerView` in your list:

```swift
@State private var advert: BillboardAd? = nil

List {
    if let advert {
        Section {
            BillboardBannerView(advert: advert, includeShadow: false)
                .listRowBackground(Color.clear)
                .listRowInsets(.init(top: 0, leading: 0, bottom: 0, trailing: 0))
        }
    }
    
    // Rest of the list...
}

```

## Configuration

Billboard lets you define some configurations to fit your needs better.

``` swift
public struct BillboardConfiguration {
    
    /// The URL pointing to the JSON in the `BillboardAdResponse` format.
    public let adsJSONURL: URL?
    
    /// Enable or disable haptics
    public let allowHaptics: Bool
    
    /// The duration of the advertisement
    public let duration: TimeInterval
    
    /// Provide a list of Apple ID's that you want to exclude from showing up (e.g. your own app)
    public let excludedIDs : [String]
    
    public init(adsJSONURL: URL? = URL(string:"https://billboard-source.vercel.app/ads.json"),
                allowHaptics: Bool = true,
                advertDuration: TimeInterval = 15.0, excludedIDs: [String] = []) {
        self.adsJSONURL = adsJSONURL
        self.allowHaptics = allowHaptics
        self.duration = advertDuration
        self.excludedIDs = excludedIDs
    }
}
```

This also allows you to use your own source of ads that follow the `BillboardAdResponse` format.

```swift

@State private var showRandomAdvert = false

let config = BillboardConfiguration(
    adsJSONURL: URL(string: "YOUR-OWN-SOURCE"),
    allowHaptics: false,
    advertDuration: 30.0,
    excludedIDs: ["1234567890"]
)

ContentView()
    .showBillboard(when: $showRandomAdvert, configuration: config) {
        // Replace this view with your Paywall
        Text("Your Paywall goes here")
    }

```


## BillboardAdResponse
Here's an example of how your source list could look like.

```json
{
  "ads" : [
    {
      "appStoreID" : "1574243765",
      "name" : "NowPlaying",
      "title": "Learn everything about any song",
      "description" : "A music companion app that lets you discover the stories behind and song, album or artist.",
      "media": "https://pub-378e0dd96b5343108a04317ebddebb4e.r2.dev/nowplaying.png",
      "backgroundColor" : "344442",
      "textColor" : "EFDED7",
      "tintColor" : "EFDED7",
      "fullscreen": false,
      "transparent": true
    }
  ]
}

```

## Ad Guidelines & Requirements
Submit your app to be featured as an Ad for everyone using the Billboard package to display Advertisements.
Each ad will be reviewed before inclusion.

**[You can submit your app here](https://forms.gle/nWV4dT3taBF62WXbA)**

Feel free to use the [Billboard template for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1257700620161188779) to tweak and preview the promo.

### Ad Requirements
- **Apple ID of App**: The Apple ID is a 9- or 10-digit number found in your App Store URL or in App Store Connect.
- **Name of App**: The name of the app you're promoting
- **Title**: The advertisement headline (maximum 25 characters).
- **Description**: The advertisement description (maximum 140 characters).
- **Media**: The image used in your advertisement.

### Media Guidelines
- Image should be a minimum of 1280x1280 in resolution.
- The image should not contain any text outside of the visual content.
- Avoid using your App Icon as the image (as it's already displayed by default).
- Provide an image with no background or has a single color (avoid gradients).
- Photos are allowed as well but will be displayed differently.

## Ad Types
The media of an ad will be displayed covering the whole view when `BillboardAd.fullscreen` is set to `true`. This works great if the media is a photo instead of a visual. Please consider that the photo's subject must be in the center, which will ensure it's always visible.
